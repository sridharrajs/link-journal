#### [How To Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) by Eric Steven Raymond

> **The Hacker Attitude**
> 
> 1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.  
> 2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.  
> 3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.  
> 4. Freedom is good.  
> 5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.  
> 
> 
> **Basic Hacking Skills**
> 
> 1. Learn how to program(**Learn Python as your first programming language**)   
> 2. Get one of the open-source Unixes and learn to use and run it (**Start with Ubuntu to begin with**)
> 3. Learn how to use the World Wide Web and write HTML.  
> 4. If you don't have functional English, learn it.  
> 
> **Status in the Hacker Culture**
> 
> 1. Write open-source software  
> 2. Help test and debug open-source software  
> 3. Publish useful information  
> 4. Help keep the infrastructure working  
> 5. Serve the hacker culture itself  


#### [The Rise of "Worse is Better"](https://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html) By Richard Gabriel

>  The lesson to be learned from this is that it is often undesirable to go for the right thing first. It is better to get half of the right thing available so that it spreads like a virus. Once people are hooked on it, take the time to improve it to 90% of the right thing. 

#### [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) by Peter Norvig

>    * Get interested in programming, and do some because it is fun. Make sure that it keeps being enough fun so that **you will be willing to put in your ten years/10,000 hours.**
>
>    * Program. **The best kind of learning is learning by doing.**
>
>    * Talk with other programmers; **read other programs.**
>
>    * If you want, put in four years at a college (or more at a graduate school). This will give you **access to some jobs that require credentials, and it will give you a deeper understanding of the field**, but if you don't enjoy school, you can (with some dedication) get similar experience on your own or on the job.
>
>    * Work on projects after other programmers. **Understand a program written by someone else.**
>
>    * **Learn at least a half dozen programming languages**. Include one language that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), and one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).
>
>    * Get involved in a language standardization effort. It could be the ANSI C++ committee, or it could be deciding if your local > coding style will have 2 or 4 space indentation levels. Either way, you learn about what other people like in a language, how deeply they feel so, and perhaps even a little about why they feel so.
>
>    * Have the good sense to get off the language standardization effort as quickly as possible. 


#### [The Duct Tape Programmer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/) by Joel Spolsky

> Here’s what Zawinski says about Netscape: “It was decisions like not using C++ and not using threads that made us ship the product on time.”
>
> “Yeah,” he says, “At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! **It’s great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the third time it’ll actually be pretty. But that’s not the point—you’re not here to write code; you’re here to ship products.**”
>
> Duct tape programmers are pragmatic. Zawinski popularized Richard Gabriel’s precept of Worse is Better. **A 50%-good solution that people actually have solves more problems and survives longer than a 99% solution that nobody has because it’s in your lab where you’re endlessly polishing the damn thing. Shipping is a feature. A really important feature. Your product must have it.**
