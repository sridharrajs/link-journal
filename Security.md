>  Do not store plaintext passwords under any circumstances. **Your service should instead store a cryptographically strong hash of the password that cannot be reversed â€” created with, for example, PBKDF2, Argon2, Scrypt, or Bcrypt.** The hash should be salted with a value unique to that specific login credential. **Do not use deprecated hashing technologies such as MD5, SHA1 and under no circumstances should you use reversible encryption or try to invent your own hashing algorithm.**
