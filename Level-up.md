> I believe that your seniority and value as a programmer is measured not in what you know, it’s measured in what you put out. The two are related but definitely not the same. **Your value is in how you move your project forward and how you empower your team to do the same.**

> Great product is built by work horses, not dressage horses.
> **Go deep before you go wide - learn your chosen stack inside out**
> If you are a Ruby developer take time to learn Ruby, especially the incredible range of array methods. If you are a Node developer take time to understand the architecture, the methods and the mindset of Node. Ask before you invent. You are walking in the shadows of giants. Take time to find their tracks and then marvel at how beautifully they have been built.

> **Learn to detect the smell of bad code**
> **Write code to be read**
> **Weigh features on their lifetime cost, not their implementation cost**
> **Understand the liability AND the leverage of Technical Debt**
> **Check and re-check your code. Your problems are yours to fix**
> **Do actual work for at least (only) four hours every day**
> **Write up the things you’ve done and share them with the team**
> **Understand and appreciate the exquisite balance between too much testing and too little**
> **Make your team better**

> The great engineers I know are as good as they are because they practice all the time. People in great physical shape only get that way by working out regularly, and they need to keep it up, or they get out of shape. The same goes for programming and engineering.

> Practice Drill #1:   Write your resume. List all your relevant skills, then note the ones that will still be needed in 100 years. Give yourself a 1-10 rating in each skill.

> Practice Drill #2:   Make a list of programmers who you admire. Try to include some you work with, since you'll be borrowing them for some drills. Make one or two notes about things they seem to do well — things you wish you were better at.

> Practice Drill #3:   Go to Wikipedia's entry for computer science, scroll down to the "Prominent pioneers in computer science" section, pick a person from the list, and read about them. Follow any links from there that you think look interesting.

> Practice Drill #4:   Read through someone else's code for 20 minutes. For this drill, alternate between reading great code and reading bad code; they're both instructive. If you're not sure of the difference, ask a programmer you respect to show you examples of each. Show the code you read to someone else, and see what they think of it.

> Practice Drill #5:   Make a list of your 10 favorite programming tools: the ones you feel you use the most, the ones you almost couldn't live without. Spend an hour reading the docs for one of the tools in your list, chosen at random. In that hour, try learn some new feature of the tool that you weren't aware of, or figure out some new way to use the tool.

> Practice Drill #6:   Pick something you're good at that has nothing to do with programming. Think about how the professionals or great masters of that discipline do their practice. What can you learn from them that you can apply to programming?

> Practice Drill #7:   Get a pile of resumes and a group of reviewers together in a room for an hour. Make sure each resume is looked at by at least 3 reviewers, who write their initials and a score (1-3). Discuss any resumes that had a wide discrepancy in scoring.

> Practice Drill #8:   Listen in on a technical phone screen. Write up your feedback afterwards, cast your vote, and then talk about the screen with the screener to see if you both reached the same conclusions.

> Practice Drill #9:   Conduct a technical interview with a candidate who's an expert in some field you don't know much about. Ask them to explain it to you from the ground up, assuming no prior knowledge of that field. Try hard to follow what they're saying, and ask questions as necessary.

> Practice Drill #10:   Get yourself invited to someone else's technical interview. Listen and learn. Try to solve the interview questions in your head while the candidate works on them.

> Practice Drill #11:   Find a buddy for trading practice questions. Ask each other programming questions, alternating weeks. Spend 10 or 15 minutes working on the problem, and 10 or 15 minutes discussing it (finished or not.)

> Practice Drill #12:   When you hear any interview coding question that you haven't solved yourself, go back to your desk and mail the question to yourself as a reminder. Solve it sometime that week, using your favorite programming language.
