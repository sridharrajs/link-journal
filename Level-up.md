> Great product is built by work horses, not dressage horses.
> **Go deep before you go wide - learn your chosen stack inside out**
> If you are a Ruby developer take time to learn Ruby, especially the incredible range of array methods. If you are a Node developer take time to understand the architecture, the methods and the mindset of Node. Ask before you invent. You are walking in the shadows of giants. Take time to find their tracks and then marvel at how beautifully they have been built.
