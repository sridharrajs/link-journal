>  Do not store plaintext passwords under any circumstances. **Your service should instead store a cryptographically strong hash of the password that cannot be reversed — created with, for example, PBKDF2, Argon2, Scrypt, or Bcrypt.** The hash should be salted with a value unique to that specific login credential. **Do not use deprecated hashing technologies such as MD5, SHA1 and under no circumstances should you use reversible encryption or try to invent your own hashing algorithm.**

## Start ups

* [What’s The Atomic Unit Of Your Product/Service?](https://avc.com/2012/08/feature-friday-whats-the-atomic-unit-of-your-productservice/)

> When you think about an MVP, it's really important to identify the atomic unit and make sure you focus the product crisply and cleanly on that object. If you think you have three or four atomic units, you are going to end up with a clunky and bloated experience and that is what you want to avoid at all costs with your MVP (particularly if you are mobile first).
