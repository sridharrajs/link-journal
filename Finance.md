* [Scott Adams’ Financial Advice](https://www.mattcutts.com/blog/scott-adams-financial-advice/)


>  1.  Make a will.
>  2.  Pay off your credit card balance.
>  3.  Get term life insurance if you have a family to support.
>  4.  Fund your company 401K to the maximum.
>  5.  Fund your IRA to the maximum.
>  6.  Buy a house if you want to live in a house and can afford it.
>  7.  Put six months’ expenses in a money market account.
>  8.  Take whatever is left over and invest it 70 percent in a stock index fund and 30 percent in a bond fund through any discount brokerage company and never touch it until retirement
>  9.  If any of this confuses you, or you have something special going on (retirement, college planning, tax issue), hire a fee-based financial planner, not one who charges you a percentage of your portfolio.
