## [Life is short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) - @paulg
 
> Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long? Since there didn't seem any way to answer this question, I stopped wondering about it. Then I had kids. That gave me a way to answer the question, and **the answer is that life actually is short**.
>
> **Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old.** If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.

> **If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.** When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that's bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

> There are two ways this kind of thing gets into your life: it's either forced on you or it tricks you. To some extent you have to put up with the bullshit forced on you by circumstances. You need to make money, and making money consists mostly of errands. 
>
> There has always been a stream of people who opt out of the default grind and go live somewhere where opportunities are fewer in the conventional sense, but life feels more authentic. 
>
>  if you consciously prioritize bullshit avoidance over other factors like money and prestige, you can probably find employers that will waste less of your time. If you're a freelancer or a small company, you can do this at the level of individual customers. If you fire or avoid toxic customers, you can decrease the amount of bullshit in your life by more than you decrease your income. while some amount of bullshit is inevitably forced on you, the bullshit that sneaks into your life by tricking you is no one's fault but your own. And yet the bullshit you choose may be harder to eliminate than the bullshit that's forced on you. As well as avoiding bullshit one should actively seek out things that matter. But different things matter to different people, and most have to learn what matters to them. 
> 
> A few are lucky and realize early on that they love math or taking care of animals or writing, and then figure out a way to spend a lot of time doing it.But most people start out with a life that's a mix of things that matter and things that don't, and only gradually learn to distinguish between them. One heuristic for distinguishing stuff that matters is to ask yourself whether you'll care about it in the future. Fake stuff that matters usually has a sharp peak of seeming to matter. That's how it tricks you. The things that matter aren't necessarily the ones people would call "important." Having coffee with a friend matters. You won't feel later like that was a waste of time.
>
> One great thing about having small children is that they make you spend time on things that matter: them. They grab your sleeve as you're staring at your phone and say "will you play with me?" And odds are that is in fact the bullshit-minimizing option. If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. **After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there.** And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.
>
> The usual way to avoid being taken by surprise by something is to be consciously aware of it. A better solution is to look at the problem from the other end. **Cultivate a habit of impatience about the things you most want to do. Don't wait before climbing that mountain or writing that book or visiting your mother.** You don't need to be constantly reminding yourself why you shouldn't wait. Just don't wait. You can probably get even more effect by paying closer attention to the time you have.
>
> The reason I'm sad about my mother is not just that I miss her but that I think of all the things we could have done that we didn't. Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.

> If you intend to have children, but you don’t intend to have them just yet, you are not banking extra years as a person who is still too young  to have children. You are subtracting years from the time you will share the world with your children.
