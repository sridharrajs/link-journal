[How Will You Measure Your Life?](https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life) by Clayton M. Christensen

> Don’t worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people

> This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.

> having a clear purpose in my life [is] essential. the powerful motivator in our lives isn’t money; it’s the opportunity to learn, grow in responsibilities, contribute to others, and be recognized for achievements.

> The choice and successful pursuit of a profession is but one tool for achieving your purpose. But without a purpose, life can become hollow

> Clarity about their purpose will trump knowledge.. Your decisions about allocating your personal time, energy, and talent ultimately shape your life’s strategy

> If you want your kids to have strong self-esteem and confidence that they can solve hard problems, those qualities won’t magically materialize in high school. You have to design them into your family’s culture and you have to think about this very early on

> I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched
