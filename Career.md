> Instead of being becoming the best at one specific thing. Try becoming very good (top 25%) at two or more things. And one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix.

> Communicate, write blog, decide whether you want to be a generalist or specialist and interview often.


* [Change careers like Tarzan](https://sivers.org/tarzan) by Derek Sivers

>  Remember how Tarzan swings through the jungle? He doesn’t let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight. So my advice is: Change careers like Tarzan. Don’t let go of the old one until the new one is supporting you. And make sure you don’t lose momentum.

>  So instead of looking for passion and purpose, just keep mastering whatever work you’ve started, becoming more and more valuable in your field. Passion and purpose will follow a great career.

> Don’t get fooled into thinking you have a life long career. At any moment, you need to be prepared to be independent and stand on your own two feet. If you prepare yourself for that, I think you are going to have a much better, sort of ride along the way. So think about yourself as self-employed.

> சி, சி++ மட்டும்தான் மென்பொருள் என்று நினைக்கிறவர்கள்தான் 'இனி ஐ.டி அவ்வளவுதான்' என்று நம்புகிறார்கள். உண்மையில் இனிமேல்தான் ஐ.டியின் அசுரத்தனமான வளர்ச்சி இருக்கப் போகிறது.

> Practice Drill #1:   Write your resume. List all your relevant skills, then note the ones that will still be needed in 100 years. Give yourself a 1-10 rating in each skill.

> Practice Drill #2:   Make a list of programmers who you admire. Try to include some you work with, since you'll be borrowing them for some drills. Make one or two notes about things they seem to do well — things you wish you were better at.

> Practice Drill #3:   Go to Wikipedia's entry for computer science, scroll down to the "Prominent pioneers in computer science" section, pick a person from the list, and read about them. Follow any links from there that you think look interesting.

> Practice Drill #4:   Read through someone else's code for 20 minutes. For this drill, alternate between reading great code and reading bad code; they're both instructive. If you're not sure of the difference, ask a programmer you respect to show you examples of each. Show the code you read to someone else, and see what they think of it.

> Practice Drill #5:   Make a list of your 10 favorite programming tools: the ones you feel you use the most, the ones you almost couldn't live without. Spend an hour reading the docs for one of the tools in your list, chosen at random. In that hour, try learn some new feature of the tool that you weren't aware of, or figure out some new way to use the tool.

> Practice Drill #6:   Pick something you're good at that has nothing to do with programming. Think about how the professionals or great masters of that discipline do their practice. What can you learn from them that you can apply to programming?

> Practice Drill #7:   Get a pile of resumes and a group of reviewers together in a room for an hour. Make sure each resume is looked at by at least 3 reviewers, who write their initials and a score (1-3). Discuss any resumes that had a wide discrepancy in scoring.

> Practice Drill #8:   Listen in on a technical phone screen. Write up your feedback afterwards, cast your vote, and then talk about the screen with the screener to see if you both reached the same conclusions.

> Practice Drill #9:   Conduct a technical interview with a candidate who's an expert in some field you don't know much about. Ask them to explain it to you from the ground up, assuming no prior knowledge of that field. Try hard to follow what they're saying, and ask questions as necessary.

> Practice Drill #10:   Get yourself invited to someone else's technical interview. Listen and learn. Try to solve the interview questions in your head while the candidate works on them.

> Practice Drill #11:   Find a buddy for trading practice questions. Ask each other programming questions, alternating weeks. Spend 10 or 15 minutes working on the problem, and 10 or 15 minutes discussing it (finished or not.)

> Practice Drill #12:   When you hear any interview coding question that you haven't solved yourself, go back to your desk and mail the question to yourself as a reminder. Solve it sometime that week, using your favorite programming language.
